# dotfiles

I am a emacs beginner user (doom emacs) and I toy with my setup and needed to store/save maybe branch it somewhere.

I mainly use ESS + org. 

## Ressources that I find useful: 

- A french :fr: (with english transcript) Mooc on reproductible science : https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:inria+41016+self-paced/info
    * it cover more than emacs but everyting is really useful from taking notes to using miniconde
